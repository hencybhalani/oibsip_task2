          <h2> Campaign for India's independence</h2>
          <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" target = "blank"><b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> </a> (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa is now used worldwide. In India, he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for "father") and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation.On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears."[51] The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood
